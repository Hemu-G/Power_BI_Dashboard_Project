# Coffee Quality Dashboard (2024)

A Power BI dashboard built using the **Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) Arabica dataset** to analyze global coffee quality trends, identify top-performing regions, and highlight key sensory factors influencing cup scores.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating coffee bean quality using real-world cupping data. The goal was to clean, transform, and visualize the dataset to generate insights useful for producers, exporters, and quality analysts.

---

## Key Features

- Analysis of **Total Cup Score**, **Aroma**, **Flavor**, **Aftertaste**, and other sensory attributes.
- Region-wise quality comparison.
- Defect-based bean quality assessment.
- Dynamic slicers for country, processing method, and bean variety.
- Clean UI for quick business-level analysis.

## Data Cleaning Summary

Performed in Python:

- Removed null and duplicate entries.
- Standardized categorical variables.
- Cleaned sensory score fields to ensure numeric consistency.
- Extracted useful features like **continent**, **bean grade**, and **quality categories**.

---

## Insights from the Dashboard

- Ethiopia and Kenya consistently produce **high-quality specialty coffee**.
- Washed processing method shows **higher overall cup scores**.
- Higher sweetness and acidity strongly correlate with higher total scores.
- Defect count is a major factor reducing cup quality.
